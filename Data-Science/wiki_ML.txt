Machine learning programs can perform tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so. It involve
s computers learning from data provided so that they carry out certain tasks. For simple tasks assig
ned to computers, it is possible to program algorithms telling the machine how to execute all steps 
required to solve the problem at hand; on the computers part, no learning is needed. For more advanc
ed tasks, it can be challenging for a human to manually create the needed algorithms. In practice, i
t can turn out to be more effective to help the machine develop its own algorithm, rather than havin
g human programmers specify every needed step.[11]
